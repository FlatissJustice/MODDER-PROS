Objectives and choices of Echo.
  Since Echos main objective is controling Indian Ocean it already starts with Oman,Somaliland and Tamil Nadu.
  Its objective should be Madagascar(French), Sumatra(Dutch), Vietnam(France), India(British), Yemen, New Zealand(British).
  This Objectives mostly involve Allies if Echo goes facist There will be a second choice to fight with Japanese against China and USA this will give parts of china with high man power to Echo.
  Democratic path will give diplomaticly Sumatra and Madagascar to Echo but Echo must join the wars allies join mainly against axis.
  Communist part will have 2 paths 1 will be with Soviet Union against Middle east and Arabia. After war against Iran, Saudi Arabia, Irak and Yemen 2 nations will be created Republic of the Arabian Assembly and Iranian Communist Authority. Iran will be soviet and arabia will be Echo Puppet. Arabia after war can demand syria from french.
  Second communist part will be about china soviet union may or may not help in this part its a 50/50 chance if they do they will get manchuria in the end and korea will be their puppet. If they don't help you will get korea as puppet and manchuria will be china again. This part is against japan if soviet union allready did the non agression pact they can't help the chinese.
  Bozanizm will be a special path this will not involve any factions Echo will be alone with his puppets. Dutch East Indies, New Zealand, Endo China and Philipines will be the objective,.
 What puppets can do 
  Puppets will act like walking the tiger chinas they will have 3 choices. Obey-Return-TakeOver. When they chose Return Echo has 1 year to capitulate them or actual countries who own them will annex them. Obey they will follow your word but that does't mean they are just going to sit down and wait you. Over take is like Return but this takes 6 months and they will note get annexed they will join a other faction in the end accomplish their objectives.
